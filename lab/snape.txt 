Snape stood up. “You have used me.”

“Meaning?”

“I have spied for you and lied for you, 
put myself in mortal danger for you. 
Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter’s son safe. 
Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter-”

“But this is touching, Severus,”said Dumbledore seriously. 
“Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?”

“For him?” shouted Snape. “Expecto Patronum!”

From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe: 
she landed on the office floor, bounded once across the office, 
and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, 
and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, 
and his eyes were full of tears.

“After all this time?”

“Always,” said Snape.
